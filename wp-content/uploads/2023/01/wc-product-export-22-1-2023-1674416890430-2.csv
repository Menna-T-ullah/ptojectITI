Our clothes are elevated staple basics that you invest in to build an iconic wardrobe with EMMA, piece by piece.\n\nBeyond being incredibly comfy, knit dresses are also incredibly versatile.  You can dress them up for date night with some standout heeled knee-high boots , or go casual for a weekend with chunky style boots. With or without a belt,  with a short jacket or a long coat, the styling options are endless!  What we love about them the most is even on its own, it’s a full outfit that’s effortlessly elegant consisting of just one piece, can’t get better than this!\n\n<strong>What’s special about Amelia:</strong> Thick premium knit gently contoured for the feminine yet modest look, not like most knit dresses that cling to your body. It gently frames your curves while maintaining a loose fit. Also it features that just perfect high collar that doesn’t need you to tuck in your scarf like other high collars! It’s also a thick and non transparent weave that doesn’t need layering beneath.
